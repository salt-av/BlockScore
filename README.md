# BlockScore : A Decentralized Sports Management System 

BlockScore is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that can be used to plan and schedule events like matches and reduce the need of a centralised governing body.

## The Problem

Most of the profit earned by two teams playing a match must go to the teams themselves but rather a major chunk of it has to be sent to the governing body like UEFA or BCCI. Despite having a continuous soruce of income, the actions of the body are never transparent and always fueled by Corruption.

## Key Features

- Directy Funding
The profit earned from the matches goes directly to the teams involved.

- Centralised System
No one entity control the sporting league, rather it is controlled by all its members.

- Hashed password
The password of each club and its data is securely hashed.
